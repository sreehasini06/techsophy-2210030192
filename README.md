 🧬 Clinical Trial Patient Matching System

A Python-based command-line application that matches patients to suitable clinical trials using eligibility criteria such as age, gender, medical conditions, and location.


 📌 Objective

To build a smart tool that reads clinical trial data and compares it with patient profiles to recommend the most relevant clinical trials ranked by a matching score.



 ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- JSON (for data storage)
- Standard Python I/O and logic



🧠 Features

- 📥 Accepts patient details through interactive input
- 🧪 Loads trial data from a JSON file
- ✅ Checks eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria
- 📊 Ranks trials using a simple scoring algorithm
- 📤 Displays sorted trial recommendations in the terminal
